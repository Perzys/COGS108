    "Police brutality and racism have been two huge social concerns in the last couple of years within the United States. For example, Black Lives Matter, a racial justice movement, was spurred by the shooting of Mike Brown, a black teenager, by a white police officer. Since then, there have not only been countless shootings but only other instances of racism within police departments. In a 2016 study it was found that while black people comprise only 13% of the United States population, they account for 28% of the arrests made [1]. With statistics such as these and increased news coverage a lot of research has been done within this area. \n",
    "\n",
    "There has been research correlating race with both the amount of traffic stops and the outcome of the stop. Waller County, Texas was recently put under the spotlight due to the mysterious death of Sandra Bland, a black woman who was taken into custody as a result of a traffic stop. According to Census estimates, Waller County is 70.5% white, 25.8% black, 1.5% Native American, and .7% Asian. Yet those who are stopped for traffic violations are only 44.3% white, 29.1% black, and 24.8% Hispanic [2]. Similar to this situation, within San Francisco it is reported that once pulled over for a traffic violation, black drivers are more than four times and Latinos more than two and a half times likely to be searched compared to white drivers [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "This information led us to form our hypothesis. In order for police brutality and racism to stop, questions such as ours must be answered. Doing data analysis such as ours not only brings light to the racism within police departments, but also gives concrete numbers and answers. With concrete data and answers it is hard to deny for both the police and the public that racism within our country is still not an issue today. \n"

    "Since we are using multiple datasets that cover similar information, specifically those datasets that deal with traffic stops, we will need to make sure that data entered under similar fields (i.e. date, race, or reason for stop) are coded in the same way across datasets in order to properly merge the data into one unified set without creating duplicates (e.g. by fixing discrepancies such as “crash” vs. “collision”). Due to the large amount of data we are working with, it is possible we may miss some differences in wording by simply searching through the data manually, so we will look for a sort of legend that may be provided through the same source as the datasets that might delineate all the terms used in the dataset. \n",

    "\n",
    "We will primarily be using statistical tests to analyze our data. Specifically, in order to assess the relationship between race and rates of traffic stops in relation to base population demographics, we will be using a chi squared goodness of fit test. This will allow us to assess whether rates of traffic stops for each race correlate to the proportion of the population that identifies as that race. If there is a discrepancy, then other factors such as racial bias may be involved. If an overall difference is found through the chi squared test, we may follow up with more specific tests (single proportion tests) to investigate within each racial group. The sample sizes and independence of the data satisfy all the assumptions required for a chi squared test so no further pre-processing will be required beyond basic cleaning as outlined above.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to assess the relationship between race and the severity of outcomes from these traffic stops, we will use a one way ANOVA and may follow up with more specific tests as with above, if we find a significant difference and wish to investigate further. A one-way ANOVA requires an assumption of normality and homoscedasticity. Normality should be given based on our large sample size, but whether there are equal variances between data for each race will need to be assessed somehow. This whole process generally will involve recoding some of the data into numbers on a scale, such as for the severity of traffic stop outcomes, and performing general arithmetic operations on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What to report (2-3 sentences)*\n",
    "\n",
    "We will report the chi squared values from the first set of tests and explain what this value means in terms of how closely traffic stop rates reflect the underlying population demographics for each racial group. If the proportions are significantly different from one another, then this indicates that some other forces are at play, possibly such as racial biases. To address the second part of our question about how race might correlate to the outcomes of traffic stops, we will we will report the outcomes of the one-way ANOVA with an explanation of what the results mean in terms of our hypothesis. For both of the above, if we choose to carry out additional, more specific tests, we will report their results as well in statistical terms as well as framed within the scope of our question.\n",

    "The main drawback of our analysis is that it is purely correlational, so conjectures about the causal nature of any relationships we find or the specific mechanisms through which such relationships are mediated are tenuous at best. Our data is more appropriate for simply assessing the existence of the problem and either corroborating or refuting the results of prior analyses regarding the disproportionate treatment of people of color. Another drawback is that our data sets are incomplete. This can be seen by the total number of observations reported compared to the complete number of traffic stops during 2016, which was 108,736. Therefore, we do expect our data to have some bias. \n",
